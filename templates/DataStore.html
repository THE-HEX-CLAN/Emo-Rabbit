            <td>Without doubt one of the favorite hotels I stayed during my time in Alwar! Upon arrival we were warmly welcomed by the staff and general manager, our names were mentioned on the board and we were upgraded to the Paradise Suite. The staff was extremely friendly, the restaurant very flexible (appreciate this!) and the restaurant supervisor deserves a special thanks. We had one great evenings here, which obviously also added up to the experience. Hospitality are so good to me from this hotel and the hospitality parter there called Mr. Sunny is so nice too me. So this was my good and healthy experience towards this hotel. Thank you</td>

            <td>Definetly one of the strangest places i stayed in Sri Lanka, it wasnt terrible, it was far from great, in terms of what we paid, value for money not even close, the going rate for this hotel should be around 40-50 dollars US a night, we payed way more than that, possible that Agoda misrepresents itself with this hotel, you think you are going to get a 5 star hotel but in the end you get like a motel 6, it truely is very low end. the staff are friendly and helpful, the rooms very basic, i think its just the value for money is where we had our problems, how i still do not understand we could have paid so much to stay there. Food was fine, there is nothing else in the area, to walk around to, its sort of not close to anything, if you are in the area, try your best to get a place in Ella, about 15 km away, a far nicer town to stay in. We were in Sri Lanka for 15 days in 5 cities and were most disappointed with this hotel. They maybe trying but its hard to turn a motel into a Shangri La.</td>

            <td>Our stay was fantastic. We usually choose small boutique hotels and this was absolutely spot on and up our street. This villa only has 4 rooms and has been recently renovated. The rooms and bathrooms are finished to a very high standard whilst authentic look and feel of the place has been retained. The place is spotless and well maintained. Staff are amazing, so friendly and attentive, it felt effortless being here. Food was absolutely amazing too, at breakfast there was a great choice of different foods. Coffee is delicious here, as the owners are Italian. We also had dinner here and invited a couple of friends who stayed elsewhere. We were all very impressed with the food in the evening, we had a selection of Italian dishes. It was nice to have pasta after 2 weeks of eating rice and curry.</td>
